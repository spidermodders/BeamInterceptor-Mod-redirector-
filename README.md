# BeamInterceptor
BeammInterceptor is an open source tool that allows players to load mods outside off the default mod folder.

# How does it work?
It hooks all of the Read and Write calls and intercepts them as soon as it detects that beamng is trying to read from a mod, that exists on the custom location

# How do I install it?
Download everything that is inside **ReadyPackage** and put it into the following folder:
- 1: Open Steam
- 2: Right click on **Beamng.Drive**
- 3: Click **"manage game files"**
- 4: Navigate to **"Bin64"**
- 5: Paste all the contents from **ReadyPackage** in there, these should be 3 files
